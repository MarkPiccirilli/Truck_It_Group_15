# Notes to Team:
This was built using Python3, Flask, and MySQL. The front-end is a template I got from here, 
https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/
There are loads of commented-out examples in the index file that can be used to make all other pages

Use these tutorials to get started:
1. https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework
2. https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-one

You'll need to
- Set up + install your own instance of MySQL
- Install Python3
- Use pip to install flask and the other libaries the tutorial calls for

I included a .sql file in the repo
Flask does not read from this, but feel free to feed it to your instance of mysql via the command line to build your schema!
If anyone else is using Cloud9 and needs help, I can show you how to use Flask and MySQL with c9 since it's slightly different

These tutorials should get you started
